    <h2>Steven</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! <br>
        My name is Steven. My degree is (currently) Computer Science, 
        with the hope to eventually get into game design. I already have
        some experiance with programming, though it is mainly with 
        JavaScript. I have worked with HTML and CSS before, so this class
        will be a nice refresher. My hobbies are... well, gaming and
        programming! (Currently working through Hades and Inscryption)<br>
        <br>
        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
        Saints for my entire life. I served my mission in the Utah, Salt
        Lake City South mission, and got back about a year ago. This is my
        favorite scripture:
        </p>
        <h3>D&C 6:34-37</h3>
        <p><i>34 Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth 
            and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my 
            rock, they cannot prevail. <br>
            35 Behold, I do not condemn you; go your ways and sin no 
            more; perform with soberness the work which I have commanded 
            you. <br>
            36 Look unto me in every thought; cdoubt not, fear not.
            37 Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also the prints 
            of the nails in my hands and feet; be faithful, keep my 
            commandments, and ye shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. <br>
            Amen.</i></p>
