                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Steven, and I am a hobby game designer. I 
                    am currently in college for my Computer Science degree.
                    Born and raised in Idaho, and have had a love for 
                    programming and games since I was young.
                </p>

                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    There are two activities that I want visitors to be 
                    able to complete on my site. First, I want people to 
                    be able to play my games, of course! But more 
                    importantly, I want people to be able to see how I 
                    think and how I work regarding game development. 
                    Thus, much of the development of this website will be 
                    on presenting the information relating to the 
                    development process. All the information needed to 
                    fill this site and complete any actions that this site 
                    offers is in my head or scattered across my notes. I 
                    just hope I can remember enough to fill it out. If 
                    need be, I can just develop another game and blog 
                    about my progress.
                </p>

                <h2>Why not just use itch.io?</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, my games are also being hosted on Itch.io, 
                    so it is understandable that one may be confused as to 
                    why I am making a whole other website to host my games. 
                    Iâ€™ll be honest, part of it is because I just wanted to 
                    make a website, and this seemed as good of an excuse as 
                    any. But since I want this to be a portfolio of my 
                    projects, and a demonstration of how I go about 
                    developing games, worlds, and stories, I want a blog 
                    format as well for future potential employers to browse 
                    and read. Plus, the fact that I was able to create a 
                    website to host all of this should be another point in 
                    my favor. If I was just to send them to itch, they would 
                    only be able to see my completed games, and all the 
                    information required to pick up and play. The entire 
                    design process and background information on the world 
                    and story is lost or difficult to find. If I have full 
                    control over the entire website, I can include all 
                    information in easy to access locations and can 
                    emphasize the information that is relevant to their 
                    study.
