      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        While I am generally quite open to share my love of programming, 
        what I often neglect to mention is how this love started. In the 
        spirit of full honesty, as I child I wanted an excuse to play 
        more video games. From this love of gaming grew a love of 
        programming, which primarily has developed itself as a love of 
        game design and development. I have made many games, and some of 
        them I am actually fairly proud of. The issue I have come across 
        is they are scattered. However, since they are all web-based, I 
        can embed them all in a website. That is my goal for this 
        assignment: to create a website to hold my creations as a sort 
        of portfolio.
      </p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The audiance of this website will be friends, family, and 
        potential employers.

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to provide a portfolio of my games 
        and game ideas. Each game page will have a blog-like section that
        details my design process and the development of the mechanics and 
        story of the games. Of course, there will also be links to play 
        the games. This should be simple, as they all currently web based.

      </ul>
      <h3>Games</h3>
      <p>
        This page will have links that leads to the two games I initially
        plan to display on here. One will be playable, the other only a 
        concept.
        <br>
        Playable Game
        <br>
        Bubbles! Will be playable, as it is a finished game. I am 
        particularly proud of it as I was able to make everything for it 
        in the space of one week. I am also thinking about expanding it 
        into a full game. Other information on this page will be about 
        the jam itself, and all I can remember about how I came up with 
        the mechanic, and challenges I encountered during development. I 
        will also relate some of the feedback that I received from people 
        who played my game.
        <br>
        Story Surrounding Other Game (blog format?)
        <br>
        There are many games that I have yet to finish. Or there are some 
        that I did finish, but I want to do again with better mechanics, 
        fleshed out characters and worlds, and superior mediums. For this 
        assignment, I will just stick to writing about one. I am still 
        thinking about which one I want to write on.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        About me
        <br>
        (No idea what I want to say here just yet, just know this will be
        a section)
        <br>
        <br>
        Purpose
        <br>
        There are two activities that I want visitors to be able to 
        complete on my site. First, I want people to be able to play my 
        games, of course! But more importantly, I want people to be able 
        to see how I think and how I work regarding game development. 
        Thus, much of the development of this website will be on 
        presenting the information relating to the development process. 
        All the information needed to fill this site and complete any 
        actions that this site offers is in my head or scattered across 
        my notes. I just hope I can remember enough to fill it out. If 
        need be, I can just develop another game and blog about my 
        progress.
        <br>
        <br>
        Why not just use itch.io?
        Currently, my games are also being hosted on Itch.io, so it is 
        understandable that one may be confused as to why I am making a 
        whole other website to host my games. Iâ€™ll be honest, part of it 
        is because I just wanted to make a website, and this seemed as 
        good of an excuse as any. But since I want this to be a portfolio 
        of my projects, and a demonstration of how I go about developing 
        games, worlds, and stories, I want a blog format as well for 
        future potential employers to browse and read. Plus, the fact that 
        I was able to create a website to host all of this should be 
        another point in my favor. If I was just to send them to itch, 
        they would only be able to see my completed games, and all the 
        information required to pick up and play. The entire design 
        process and background information on the world and story is lost 
        or difficult to find. If I have full control over the entire 
        website, I can include all information in easy to access locations 
        and can emphasize the information that is relevant to their study.
