                        I am particularly proud of it as I was able to make everything for it in the space of one week. I am also thinking about expanding it into a full game. Other information on this page will be about the jam itself, and all I can remember about how I came up with the mechanic, and challenges I encountered during development. I will also relate some of the feedback that I received from people who played my game.

                        There are many games that I have yet to finish. Or there are some that I did finish, but I want to do again with better mechanics, fleshed out characters and worlds, and superior mediums. For this assignment, I will just stick to writing about one. I am still thinking about which one I want to write on.
