                        Bubbles! is a 2d platformer game that requires you to jump from
                        bubble to bubble to reach the end. It was made using the Godot
                        game engine in the space of 72 hours for the Mini Jam 84. The theme
                        we were given was Bubbles, with a limitation of "you are your own
                        ammo." My goal was initially to use yourself as a projectile to 
                        attack enemies and break through walls, but it became more of a
                        precision-platformer in the end. I will expand it to a full game 
                        in the future.

                        Likely my most ambitious project to date, Labyrinth will be a top 
                        down roguelike, simmilar to the Binding of Issac. My sister has 
                        already provided much of the art, I have just been struggling to nail
                        down the mechanics. The idea that inspired this game is <br>"pain is 
                        currency."<br> As you progress from room to room, you can purchace
                        upgrades in exchange for your injuries, healing you in the process.
                        Coming up with ideas for how to balance this idea has been tricky.
